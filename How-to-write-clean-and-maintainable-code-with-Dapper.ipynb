    "# How to write clean and maintainable code with Dapper\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing clean and maintainable code with Dapper is a skill that can help you create efficient and robust data access layers for your applications. Dapper is a micro-ORM (object-relational mapper) that allows you to map your database tables and columns to your C# classes and properties. It also provides a simple and fast way to execute SQL queries and commands.\n",
    "To write clean and maintainable code with Dapper, you can follow some of these tips and best practices:\n",
    "* Use __modular code__ that is easy to maintain and test. Break down your code into smaller, reusable modules that can be used across your codebase. Use interfaces and abstractions to define the interactions between modules.\n",
    "* Use __meaningful names__ for your classes, properties, methods, variables, and parameters. Avoid using abbreviations, acronyms, or generic names that can cause confusion or ambiguity. Use consistent naming conventions and follow the C# coding standards.\n",
    "* Use __concise and clear code__ that expresses your intent and logic. Avoid unnecessary complexity, redundancy, or noise words that can make your code hard to read or understand. Use comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of your code.\n",
    "* Use __reusable code__ that avoids duplication and promotes consistency. Use Dapper's extension methods, query builders, and custom mappers to simplify your data access code and reduce boilerplate code. Use Dapper's multi-mapping feature to map multiple objects from a single query.\n",
    "* Use __clear flow of execution__ that follows the single responsibility principle. Each method or module should have one and only one reason to change. Use Dapper's async and await keywords to perform asynchronous data access operations and avoid blocking the main thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these tips and best practices, let's assume that we want to create a data access layer for the Product table, which contains information about the products that the company sells. The Product table has the following schema:\n",
    "| Column Name | Data Type | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| ProductID | int | The primary key for the Product table |\n",
    "| Name | nvarchar(50) | The name of the product |\n",
    "| ProductNumber | nvarchar(25) | The unique product number |\n",
    "| Color | nvarchar(15) | The color of the product |\n",
    "| StandardCost | money | The standard cost of the product |\n",
    "| ListPrice | money | The selling price of the product |\n",
    "| Size | nvarchar(5) | The size of the product |\n",
    "| Weight | decimal(8,2) | The weight of the product |\n",
    "| ProductCategoryID | int | The foreign key to the ProductCategory table |\n",
    "| ProductModelID | int | The foreign key to the ProductModel table |\n",
    "| SellStartDate | datetime | The date when the product was available for sale |\n",
    "| SellEndDate | datetime | The date when the product was no longer available for sale |\n",
    "| DiscontinuedDate | datetime | The date when the product was discontinued |\n",
    "| rowguid | uniqueidentifier | The row identifier for the table |\n",
    "| ModifiedDate | datetime | The date when the row was last updated |\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to write clean and maintainable code with Dapper is to create a C# class that represents the Product entity. This class will map the columns of the Product table to its properties. We can use the following code to create the Product class:"
