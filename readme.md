# Dapper Recipes

The Dapper Recipes are for developers who want to quickly learn how to use the Dapper in C# by examples. Each recipe is designed to focus on solving specific problems or tasks.

__Quick start__: 

1. Download and install the AdventureWorks2022 sample database https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks2022.bak
2. Modify the SQL Server connection string in AppSettings.cs to match with your SQL Server name.
3. Open a C# Jupyter notebook .ipynb file with Visual Studio Code and run it.
