    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Dapper is a simple object mapper for .NET that allows you to execute SQL queries and map the results to objects. It is a micro-ORM that is fast, lightweight, and easy to use. Dapper was created by the developers of Stack Overflow to improve the performance and scalability of their websiteÂ¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the reasons to use Dapper are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is faster than most other ORM tools, such as Entity Framework, because it does not generate SQL for you or track changes to your objects. It only maps the data from the database to your objects and vice versa.\n",
    "* It is simple and intuitive, requiring minimal configuration and code. You can write your own SQL queries and use Dapper's extension methods to execute them and map the results. You can also use stored procedures, dynamic parameters, and multiple result sets with Dapper.\n",
    "* It is cross-platform and compatible with .NET and .NET Core. You can use Dapper with any database provider that supports ADO.NET, such as SQL Server, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.\n",
    "* It is open-source and well-maintained, with a large and active community of users and contributors. You can find many resources, tutorials, and extensions for Dapper online."

    "### Some of the commonly used Dapper extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the popular Dapper extensions that can enhance your Dapper experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dapper.Contrib**: A collection of extension methods for Dapper that simplifies the CRUD operations, such as Insert, Update, Delete, and Get. It also supports automatic key generation, optimistic concurrency, and dirty tracking.\n",
    "* **Dapper.FluentMap**: A library that allows you to configure the mapping between your domain classes and database tables using a fluent API. It also supports convention-based mapping, custom mapping strategies, and attribute mapping.\n",
    "* **Dapper.SimpleCRUD**: A library that provides basic CRUD operations for Dapper, similar to Dapper.Contrib, but with some additional features, such as support for composite keys, enums, and SQL builders.\n",
    "* **Dapper.Rainbow**: A library that provides a lightweight database abstraction layer on top of Dapper, inspired by the Massive ORM. It allows you to perform CRUD operations, as well as query, join, and paginate data using a fluent API.\n",
    "* **Dapper.Mapper**: A library that extends the IDbConnection and IDbTransaction interfaces to provide support for multiple result sets. It allows you to map the results of a stored procedure or a SQL query to multiple objects in a single round trip to the database.\n",
